                    <hr>
                    <p>The mission of the STAR Center is to help any person with any disability to realize their potential.
                      Our mission gives us a constant and shared purpose. It guides us on every decision we make, large and small. It is the reason we were started, the reason we exist today, and it is the reason that we will continue tomorrow.
                      It is intended to be spoken aloud in the form of “any person – with any disability – to realize their potential!”
                      The STAR Center’s vision is to realize our own potential so that we may best serve others.
                      Our vision is one of constant improvement, always keeping in mind that we exist to help others. We are driven to find ways to better our services, our technology, and our people and expand to where there is a need.      
                      Our vision is intended for our leadership and staff, but it also holds us to high standards to the public that we serve.

                        <h3>Core Values and Motto</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Our Core Values are Dignity, Individualized Solutions, Compassion, and Technology.
                          Our Motto is
                          Education, Employment, Independence

                          These are the guiding principles for how we help people with disabilities realize their potential.

                          Our services are not an end in themselves, but rather a means to an end. We believe in the lifelong value of education, the dignity of employment, and the self-esteem one finds in independence. We serve others with the purpose of helping them find individualized success in these areas.
