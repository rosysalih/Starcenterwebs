 <p>Our group name is Lets call the whole thing office, our names are Razan Salih and Sebastian Soriano, we both go to Madison Academic High school. Our website is for the Star center Jackson TN,. We made this website to help parents find a place where they can trust to help their kids.Sebastian worked on the news and events page and the navbar and the footer , he faced some difficulties while trying to get the gradient to work. Razan worked onn the services and home and contact and the rest of the pages. She faced troubles with styling them , it was tough for her to get the hovers to work. Sebastian liked coding and Razan realised that she wanted to be a computer programmer because she liked coding.</p>
